# Project Proposal #

## Reaction ##


**Summary**

- What is main technical content of the papers?
- How do the papers relate to the topics presented in the course?
- What is the connection between the papers you are discussing?

**Critique**

- What are strengths and weaknesses of the papers and how could they be addressed?
- What were the authors missing?
- Was anything particularly unrealistic?

**Brainstorming (that then leads to the project proposal)**

- What are promising further research questions in the direction of the papers?
- How could they be pursued?
- An idea of a better model for something? A better algorithm? A test of a model or  - algorithm on a dataset or simulated data?


## Proposal ##

**When writing the proposal you should try to answer the following questions:**

- What is the problem you are solving?
- What data will you use (how will you get it)?
- What work do you plan to do for the project?
- Which algorithms/techniques/models do you plan to use/develop? Be as specific as you can!
- How will you evaluate your method? How will you test it? How will you measure success?
- What do you expect to submit/accomplish by the end of the quarter?

**Some other points to note:**

- The project should contain at least some amount of mathematical analysis, and some experimentation on real or synthetic data
- The result of the project will typically be a 8 page paper, describing the approach, the results, and the related work.
