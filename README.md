## About the project ##

## Contributing to our models ##

All of our models (including a template and examples) can be found in the `/models` directory. All examples are standalone `.html` files with inline coffeescript, while the template model follows the same structure as each of our custom models:

```bash
/model-name
    model-name.coffee  # The coffeescript file in which we do most of our work.
    model-name.html    # The html page that contains the dynamic model.
    model-name.js      # The compiled version of `model-name.coffee`.
```

#### Working in Coffeescript ####

To install Coffeescript with the Node Package Manager:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g coffee-script
```

To continuously compile coffeescript into the `.js` files required in the models `.html`, run the following:

```bash
$ coffee â€“wc -o /path/to/coffee/files /path/to/js/files/*.coffee
```

For example, when working on our template model:

```bash
$ cd models/_tempate/
$ coffee -wc -o . *.coffee

```

## AgentScript ##

Our work relies heavily on [AgentScript](http://agentscript.org/), a minimalist Agent Based Modeling framework in Javascript/Coffescript based on NetLogo agent semantics. The framework has very thorough docs and modeling examples on their Github Pages site.
